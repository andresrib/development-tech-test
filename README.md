# developmente-tech-test

How to run: 

npm run devStart


Explanation of my technology choices:
I choose nodeJs with Express because I see it as a more prevalent technology in the market and SqLite because for a simple application, it does everything that is needed, it is also easier for the evaluator to test the code and see it running, since the database goes with the code to the remote repository and doesn't need any setup to test, but, due to the limitations of SqLite, I had to store the datetime fields as text.
